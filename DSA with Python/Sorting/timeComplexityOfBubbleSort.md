The time complexity of comparison-based sorting algorithms is based on the number of comparisons. Therefore, the time complexity is:

time complexity = O(n2)
Worst Case Complexity: O(n2)
Average Case Complexity: O(n2)
best case = O(n)

In the best-case scenario, the list is already sorted. In this situation, no swaps occur, and the loop terminates after the first iteration of the outer loop.

Space Complexity
The space complexity of the bubble sort is O(1) because it only requires a constant amount of additional space for its variables.

Applications of Bubble Sort
When to use bubble sort?

Use bubble sort for

Small datasets.
When simplicity is more important than efficiency.
When the data is already partially sorted.
When not to use bubble sort?

Avoid bubble sort for large datasets and performance-critical applications.

In such cases, sorting algorithms like merge sort or quick sort are more suitable.
