Import NumPy Library
To use NumPy in Python, we first need to import it.

We can import NumPy in Python using the import statement.

import numpy
The code above imports the numpy library in our program.

However, it is a common convention to import NumPy with an alias.

import numpy as np
We shorten the imported name to np for better readability of code using NumPy. This is a widely adopted convention that you should follow so that anyone working with your code can easily understand it.

Once we import NumPy, we can use NumPy functions and objects by calling them using np.

For example, in our first program, np.array() is the function provided by the NumPy library and we could easily access it using np.
