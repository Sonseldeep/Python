Your First NumPy Program
Let's write our first NumPy program to get the feel of NumPy.

We will write a simple program that displays array items on the screen.

# import numpy as np

# numpy array of integers

# array1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])

# print(array1)

Here, we have created a NumPy array called array1.

To run this program, press the "Run Code" button.

Don't worry if you don't understand the above code. For now, just understand that NumPy code is a Python code with the NumPy library imported into it.
