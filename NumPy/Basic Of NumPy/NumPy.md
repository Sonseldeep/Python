What is Numpy?

As discussed earlier, Numpy is an open-source library used to handle multi-dimensional data with ease. It has a data structure called ndarray, which is the reason behind NumPy's efficiency.

NumPy provides out-of-the-box functions for statistics and algebra which can be used to create high-performance tools using multidimensional arrays. These tools come in handy in various computational scenarios where we need fast operations.

Let's explore some of the reasons why NumPy is preferred over Python lists.

1. Faster Execution

Operations that require a lot of effort and time can be done easily in less time. It has been found that just switching from Python lists to NumPy arrays can provide up to a 100x performance improvement.

The reason why NumPy is so fast is because it is created using high-performance languages like C and C++.

2. Used with Various Libraries

NumPy is heavily used with various libraries like Pandas, SciPy, scikit-learn, etc.

3. Broad Application Domain

NumPy is used in high-level applications like Quantum Computing, Signal Processing, Bioinformatics, Machine Learning, and many more.

4. Arrays are Homogeneous

NumPy arrays are homogeneous, meaning they can only store elements of the same data type, enabling efficient storage and computation.
