None:

The None keyword is used to indicate null i.e. no value.

x = None
print(x) # None

As we know, a function can return a value. However, if we do not return a value, the function returns None. For example,

def greet():
print("Hey")

result = greet()
print(result)

Output

Hey
None

Here, the greet() function doesn't return any value, which means it returns None.
