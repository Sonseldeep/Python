Modules Introduction:

since there are many built-in function such as sum(), max()
len() etc. that help us solve problems quickly and easily

in addition to these build in functions, using modules provides more functions that we can use in our programs

BUT, WHAT IS MODULE

A module is a file containing a set of functions that we might to use in our application. Once we import a module, we can use all the functions define inside that module

WHY MODULES?
You might have heard of that Python is used for data analytics, web development and automation
To solve these task, we take help of modules rather than writing code from scratch

For example, if we need to perform tasks related to

data analytics, we will use modules such as NumPy, pandas, etc.
web development, we will use modules such as Django, Flask, etc.
csv files, we will use modules such as csv, pandas, etc.

These modules are created by the awesome Python community and are free to use. In this lesson, we will learn to use modules in our program.

Importing Modules:

import math
inside math module, there are many useful mathematical functions.
Once we import modules, we can use functions like sqrt()

import math

number = 25

# compute square root

result = math.sqrt(number)

print(result) # 5.0
