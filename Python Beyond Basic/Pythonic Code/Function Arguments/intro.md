Let's start with what we already know about arguments.

# def display_info(name, age):

# print(name)

# print(age)

# display_info('Amanda', 22)

Output

Amanda
22

Here, we have passed two arguments to the display_info() function. In the program, the name parameter takes 'Amanda' and the age parameter takes 22.

These arguments are called positional arguments because the arguments are assigned based on their position.

The first argument in the function call is assigned to the first argument in the function definition. Similarly, the second argument is assigned to the second argument in the function definition.
